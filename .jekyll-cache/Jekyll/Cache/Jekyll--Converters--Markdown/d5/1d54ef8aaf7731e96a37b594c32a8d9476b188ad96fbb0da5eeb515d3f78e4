I"¥<p>I tweeted offhandedly a few days ago that I wanted to do more music stuff with friends in 2023, since it hasnâ€™t really ever happened organically for me but is always something Iâ€™d wished I was a part of!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wanna swap stems with more music pals this year, demos, WIPs, 4 bar ideas, riffs, beats, prod ideas, im keen :)</p>&mdash; wolfjay (@wo1fjay) <a href="https://twitter.com/wo1fjay/status/1608984204133691393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>A few friends replied and DMâ€™d me so I thought Iâ€™d put something together âœ¨</p>

<p>I realised that that working out an approach for sharing little bits of ideas could have a lot of overlap with another idea Iâ€™ve wanted to try for agesâ€¦ making little bits of ideas!</p>

<p>One of my favourite artists, Takagi Masakatsu, has an ongoing series of small compositions called â€˜Marginaliaâ€™. They are daily piano recordings at Takagiâ€™s private studio surrounded by mountains in Hyogo, Japan. As per his Bandcamp, â€œopen all the windows, welcome sounds from the nature, playing the Piano without preparing, no overdubbing, no fixing, just as it is.â€.</p>

<p>I think this is very beautiful! Itâ€™s very interesting how ideas in these short recordings echo throughout his larger, more prepared works.</p>
