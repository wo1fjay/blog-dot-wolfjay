<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wanna swap stems with more music pals this year, demos, WIPs, 4 bar ideas, riffs, beats, prod ideas, im keen :)</p>&mdash; wolfjay (@wo1fjay) <a href="https://twitter.com/wo1fjay/status/1608984204133691393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2022</a></blockquote>
