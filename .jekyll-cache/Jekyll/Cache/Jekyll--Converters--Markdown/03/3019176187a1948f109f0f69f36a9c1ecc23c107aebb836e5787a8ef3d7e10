I"¸	<p>uh hi :)</p>

<p>my name is jackie :) iâ€™ve been doing stuff as wolfjay since 2017 :)</p>

<p>This is a little blog for me to drop down thoughts about things. Iâ€™ve tried having a website in the past bdsut I donâ€™t think many people looked at it and it made me anxious about writing things on it because it looked so fancy and the writing wasnâ€™t fancy.</p>

<p>iâ€™ve wanted a little blog for so long!</p>

<p>My friends talk about their â€˜tumblr phasesâ€™ and pull up their archives of posts and have beautiful imperfect records of what they were into at different times. I do not :) my online existence has been scattered across platforms and phases and friendship groups and communities. From the outside I think it would look like Iâ€™m just really inconsistent and non-committal, but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s fair. Iâ€™m so ready to commit to something, Iâ€™m just trying to find something that feels nice.</p>

<p>I like forums, theyâ€™re cool, but sometimes I just forget they exist and disappear.</p>

<p>I like twitter, but thereâ€™s so much going on there. Are my tweets still cool if no one else thinks theyâ€™re cool?</p>

<p>Facebook sucks</p>

<p>Instagram sucks</p>

<p>Close friends is ehhhhhhh, but I feel shitty if I share something and no one responds</p>

<p>so hereâ€™s a little blog :) I fought with the command line on my computer for a solid 2 hours today to get it to compile properly.</p>

<p>It looks shitty at the moment :)</p>

<p>am going to keep fucking around with things and build up a nice little custom theme for myself maybe!</p>

<p>I learned about Jekyll during university and setup my first site with the help of someone in my class for a journal while I was in bangkok on a month long study trip. It sucked! I overcooked it too much and made it not fun.</p>

<p>I have a few ideas for things I want to write about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>annual report each year on my income from music and what I spent money on</li>
  <li>breakdowns of projects and go into all the nitty gritty detail that gets glossed over when just publishing shit</li>
  <li>try and breakdown my thought processes around new things I want to do</li>
  <li>forget this exists for a while and disappear while I do fun things then pop back when I want to talk about those things :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways I think Iâ€™m all done for now, I want to publish this tonight then get something to eat and hang out with my dogs. lol first blog post hehe</p>

<p>xoxo gossip wolfjay</p>
