I"<p>I tweeted offhandedly a few days ago that I wanted to do more music stuff with friends in 2023, since it hasn’t really ever happened organically for me but is always something I’d wished I was a part of!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wanna swap stems with more music pals this year, demos, WIPs, 4 bar ideas, riffs, beats, prod ideas, im keen :)</p>&mdash; wolfjay (@wo1fjay) <a href="https://twitter.com/wo1fjay/status/1608984204133691393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>A few friends replied and DM’d me so I thought I’d put something together ✨</p>

<p>I realised that that working out an approach for sharing little bits of ideas could have a lot of overlap with another idea I’ve wanted to try for ages… making little bits of ideas!</p>

<p>One of my favourite artists, Masakatsu Takagi, has an <a href="https://takagimasakatsu.bandcamp.com">ongoing series of small compositions called ‘Marginalia’</a>. They are daily piano recordings at Takagi’s private studio surrounded by mountains in Hyogo, Japan. As per his Bandcamp, “open all the windows, welcome sounds from the nature, playing the Piano without preparing, no overdubbing, no fixing, just as it is.”</p>

<p>I think this is very beautiful! It’s very interesting how ideas in these short recordings echo throughout his larger, more prepared works. I would definitely reccomend spending some time with them.</p>
