I"ˆ<p>I had planned to officially drop an EP before the end of the year, but life got in the way, so instead Iâ€™m sharing thisâ€”<a href="https://wolfjay.bandcamp.com/album/demo-cd-2023"><strong>DEMO CD 2023</strong></a>. Think of it like a video game demo disk off a cover of PlayStation magazine in 2002, except itâ€™s music. And itâ€™s made by me. And you can <a href="https://wolfjay.bandcamp.com/album/demo-cd-2023">buy it now on Bandcamp!</a></p>

<p>Iâ€™m trying to find new ways of sharing music outside of big traditiional releases because they take a lot of time and can be very expensive. Playing live is my favourite way of sharing works in progress, but live shows are inaccessible for a lot of people, so I thought this might be another fun option! This release wonâ€™t go on streaming, but the songs on it will all get official big releases one day hopefully âœ¨</p>

<h4 id="heres-a-bit-of-the-story-behind-each-of-the-songs-">Hereâ€™s a bit of the story behind each of the songs ğŸ˜Œ</h4>

<h3 id="1-in-realtime">1. In Realtime</h3>

<p><strong><em>â€œtake a deep breathe and forget about all that, youâ€™re here in the present now, for now, for nowâ€</em></strong></p>

<p>In Realtime came out of nowhere. I sat down at my desk one Saturday, opened a new Logic session, and just made it. It happened so quickly. I started it at 10am and submitted the mastered track to streaming at 11pm. One of the rare times I just get in the zone and every new idea builds perfectly on the last. It feels like a perfect evolution of what Iâ€™ve done before and what new attitudes I want to draw out from my music going forward. A blessing. ğŸ™</p>

<h3 id="2-i-hope-it-makes-me-feel-better-demo">2. I Hope It Makes Me Feel Better (Demo)</h3>

<p>I wrote I Hope It Makes Me Feel Better in the months waiting for my ADHD screening session, trying to plan ahead but not really being sure what was going to happen. During that time I also decided to leave the label I had been signed to for the last few years, which was really the last thing holding me to a dream Iâ€™d had an unhealthy obsession with since starting Wolfjay. Of moving to NYC and being a part of the music community there. It all fell apart at the start of COVID but has been hard to let go off.</p>

<p>This song is about time moving very fast, and the future running at you at full speed, but also about understanding that this moment will feel like it happened a long time ago in the very near future. Iâ€™m trying to do my best, despite <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>â€œiâ€™ll do things when iâ€™m ready to, album was due on the third of june. 2023â€™s getting closer, 2023â€™s going quickly, 2023 was so long ago.â€</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="3-personality-ft-ella-stik-demo">3. Personality ft. Ella Stik (Demo)</h3>

<p>This song fucking rips. Itâ€™s very silly and very fun. Iâ€™ve played it at a few shows lately and just lands so well every time. Maybe the most fun wolfjay song? Also features someone from the internet that Iâ€™m a big fan of &lt;3 long live ella stik ğŸ’—</p>

<h3 id="4-all-along-ft-crook--shahrae-slowed-and-reverbed-edit">4. All Along ft. Crook &amp; Shahrae (Slowed and Reverbed Edit)</h3>

<p><strong><em>â€œand iâ€™ll pass you in the street, pretend I donâ€™t recognise your face, anymore, anymore, anymore â€” remember a memory of me, and realise it was a lie, all along, all along, all alongâ€</em></strong></p>

<p>An edit, of a remix, of one of my own songs, featuring my friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/crookedycrook/?hl=en">Crook</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shahraeee/?hl=en">Shahrae</a>. A silly idea executed with complete sincerity and conviction. Dropping early 2023 alongside the standard edit. Stay tuned ğŸ¦‹</p>

<h3 id="5-damned-demo">5. Damned (Demo)</h3>

<p>Wolfjay brutalist pop mode? A song about how soul wrenching it can be to get romantically involved with a friend, deliberately blurring lines and then struggling to get a clear view of the situation.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not perfect, yet, but Iâ€™m super proud of the lyrics and production on this song. I wrote it with naarm/melb nb angel <a href="https://www.instagram.com/guthriesounds/?hl=en">Guthrie</a> who breathed so much life into it.</p>

<p><strong><em>â€œfeels like Iâ€™ve lived this night before, backroom of a share house that I used to know,
my chem on the boom, all our friends are gone, iâ€™m making eyes at you, youâ€™re making eyes at me as wellâ€</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>â€œdamned if we do, damned if we donâ€™t, we can take it slow, we can take it anywhere, said you donâ€™t know how to keep this cool, itâ€™s all new for you, but itâ€™s all new for me as wellâ€</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>â€œi just wanna hang out all night, fuck around, make you laugh, get high, try not to think about the way this feels, iâ€™m just happy to feel comfortable around someone else at lastâ€</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="5-pretty-demo">5. Pretty (Demo)</h3>

<p>This one is very early on in development still but fuck itâ€”I think it rips. If people are dancing to it at shows thereâ€™s no reason you canâ€™t dance to it at home now as well ğŸ§¡ will likely change a bunch and I have no idea when itâ€™ll officially drop so here it is, in itâ€™s current beautiful and unfinished form. Pretty.</p>

<p><strong><em>â€œiâ€™m sick of waiting, itâ€™s debilitating, when the features of your face, donâ€™t match your heartâ€</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="thank-u-for-checking-out-my-little-demo-cd-i-hope-its-made-you-smile-and-dance-and-process-feelings-and-thoughts-like-its-done-for-me-while-making-it">thank u for checking out my little demo cd! I hope itâ€™s made you smile and dance and process feelings and thoughts like itâ€™s done for me while making it.</h4>
