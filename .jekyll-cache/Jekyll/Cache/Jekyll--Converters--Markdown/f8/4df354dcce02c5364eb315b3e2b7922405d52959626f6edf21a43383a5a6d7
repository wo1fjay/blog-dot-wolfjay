<p>In primary school, I was just undisciplined, lazy, a ‚Äúgifted student‚Äù who lacked the dedication to fulfil my potential.</p>

<p>In high school, I was just depressed, anxious, and ‚Äúemo‚Äù - to the point of breaking the school‚Äôs record for absentee days (91 in a single year) while still being near the top of most of my classes.</p>

<p>As an adult, I was just unfocused, inconsistent, and unreliable.</p>

<p>This led to really poor mental health, which led to mental health care plans, which led to counsellors trying to give me new ways of framing the same shitty situations. I felt like an alien. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was incredibly isolated from people around me, other than the people I bonded with specifically over our shared struggles with undiagnosed ADHD symptoms - particularly members of the queer community.</p>

<h3 id="but-with-everyone-i-looked-up-to-growing-up-telling-me-i-just-needed-to-work-harder-i-kept-pushing-and-struggling-and-burning-out">But with everyone I looked up to growing up telling me I just needed to work harder, I kept pushing and struggling and burning out.</h3>

<p>I thought it might just be anxious about money, so slowly got better-paying jobs. I thought it might be stress from turbulent living situations, so I moved out on my own. I thought it might be an addiction to work, so adopted a few dogs to keep me active and distract me from constantly working.</p>

<p>But even after all of those things, I was still struggling all of the time. And a lot of my friends haven‚Äôt made it that far. <strong>A few of my friends didn‚Äôt make it that far.</strong></p>

<p>For a while, I thought I was just clever enough to keep my head above water despite everything. But now I realise it‚Äôs because despite undiagnosed ADHD I was given opportunities, flexibility, and the benefit of the doubt that isn‚Äôt given to everyone. I‚Äôm a young, 28-year-old, mostly healthy, white person, with a western name, who can easily pass as a straight white cis man in most situations.</p>

<p>My friends who were only diagnosed with ADHD as adults didn‚Äôt grow up wealthy. I do not think that‚Äôs a coincidence. My friends who didn‚Äôt make it to 28 weren‚Äôt given the same benefit of the doubt I have been afforded. I do not think that‚Äôs a coincidence. Health does not exist in a vacuum, and privilege seeps into every crevice and influences everything it touches.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of my friends, and at any other point in my adult life, I was able to afford the upfront $950 fee and wait for my Medicare rebate. <strong>What happens for people who can‚Äôt afford that?</strong></p>

<p>I waited four months for my telehealth session. It went well. I saw <a href="https://www.yourhealthinmind.org/find-a-psychiatrist/profile/7841/dr-steve-chau?country=AU&amp;state=VIC&amp;seed=957843&amp;onlineConsultations=false&amp;radius=10&amp;expertiseIn=%5B%5D&amp;servicesOffered=%5B31%5D&amp;experienceWith=%5B%5D&amp;treatsAges=%5B%5D&amp;languages=%5B%5D&amp;page=1">Dr Steven Chau at The Melbourne Clinic</a> who had been recommended to me by a lovely queer friend around my age who had recently been diagnosed with ADHD. It lasted a few hours. Dr Chau asked me about my experiences growing up, at school, and at work. What things are like for me socially. I told him as much as I could. Most of it was very hard to recall. <em>A lot of memories I‚Äôd tried to forget.</em></p>

<p>I received my report in an email. ADHD, social anxiety, and maybe somewhere on the Autism spectrum as well. I thought of my queer friends who hadn‚Äôt managed to get an appointment with someone sympathetic to queer experiences and spent so much money only to not be treated fairly.</p>

<p>I went to my GP, did a blood test and an ECG, waited a few days, and got my Ritalin prescription. I slowly increased my dosage over a few weeks until I felt I reached a comfortable balance. Made an appointment for an Autism screening session.</p>

<p>Ritalin is helping me tap into that hyper-focus mode more easily now. Is this what day-to-day life is like for other people? It feels strange to be just able to be productive like this. I‚Äôm trying to cherish it. Other than that though I have a lot of homework to do. I still don‚Äôt understand why my brain is the way it is, what stimulates it and what makes it struggle. But knowing that some of those feelings have a name now has helped me finally feel like less of an alien. Less of an outlier. <strong>More human.</strong></p>

Wondering what my life would be like if I had been diagnosed as a kid. When I told my mum that I had been diagnosed she said she had always had a hunch that I might have something. <em>I wonder what life would have been like.</em></h3>

<p>I‚Äôm trying hard to think about all the times my inconsistency and missed deadlines and lack of focus were met with opportunities and chances and grace. I wonder what life would have been like if I looked different or sounded different or was born in a different place. <strong>I wonder would life would have been like.</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôm moving forward with more of an understanding of my brain than I‚Äôve ever had before, and I hope as many people as possible can have that same experience.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre a queer person who hasn‚Äôt been able to afford to go through the process of an ADHD screening, please reach out. My email is <a href="mailto:contact@wolfjay.com">contact at wolfjay dot com</a>. I don‚Äôt have much money, but I do have a small community of people who care. I‚Äôd like to help if I can, in whatever way is useful to you. Thank you for reading this, <em>and if you‚Äôre ever in doubt</em> - <strong>please know that you are human and that you aren‚Äôt alone.</strong></p>
