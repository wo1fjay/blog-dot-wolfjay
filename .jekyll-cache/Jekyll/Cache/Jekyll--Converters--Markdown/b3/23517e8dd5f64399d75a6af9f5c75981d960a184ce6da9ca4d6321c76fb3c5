<p>In primary school, I was just undisciplined, lazy, a “gifted student” who lacked the dedication to fulfil my potential.</p>

<p>In high school, I was just depressed, anxious, and “emo” - to the point of breaking the school’s record for absentee days (91 in a single year) while still being near the top of most of my classes.</p>

<p>As an adult, I was just unfocused, inconsistent, and unreliable.</p>

<p>This led to really poor mental health, which led to mental health care plans, which led to counsellors trying to give me new ways of framing the same shitty situations. I felt like an alien. I didn’t feel like I was incredibly isolated from people around me, other than the people I bonded with specifically over our shared struggles with undiagnosed ADHD symptoms - particularly members of the queer community.</p>

<h3 id="but-with-everyone-i-looked-up-to-growing-up-telling-me-i-just-needed-to-work-harder-i-kept-pushing-and-struggling-and-burning-out">But with everyone I looked up to growing up telling me I just needed to work harder, I kept pushing and struggling and burning out.</h3>

<p>I thought it might just be anxious about money, so slowly got better-paying jobs. I thought it might be stress from turbulent living situations, so I moved out on my own. I thought it might be an addiction to work, so adopted a few dogs to keep me active and distract me from constantly working.</p>

<p>But even after all of those things, I was still struggling all of the time.</p>

<p><em>And a lot of my friends haven’t made it that far.</em></p>

<h2 id="a-lot-of-my-friends-didnt-make-it-that-far">A lot of my friends didn’t make it that far.</h2>

<p>For a while, I thought I was just clever enough to keep my head above water despite everything. But now I realise it’s because despite undiagnosed ADHD I was given opportunities, flexibility, and the benefit of the doubt that isn’t given to everyone. I’m a young, 28-year-old, mostly healthy, white person, with a western name, who can easily pass as a straight white cis man in most situations.</p>

<p>My friends who were only diagnosed with ADHD as adults didn’t grow up wealthy. I do not think that’s a coincidence. My friends who didn’t make it to 28 weren’t given the same benefit of the doubt I have been afforded. I do not think that’s a coincidence. Health does not exist in a vacuum, and privilege seeps into every crevice and influences everything it touches.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of my friends, and at any other point in my adult life, I was able to afford the upfront $950 fee and wait for my Medicare rebate.</p>

<p><strong>What happens to the people who can’t afford that?</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-its-going">How it’s going</h2>

<p>I waited four months for my telehealth session. It went well. I saw Dr Steven Chau at The Melbourne Clinic who had been recommended to me by a lovely queer friend around my age who had recently been diagnosed with ADHD. It lasted a few hours. Dr Chau asked me about my experiences growing up, at school, and at work. What things are like for me socially. I told him as much as I could. Most of it was very hard to recall. <em>A lot of memories I’d tried to forget.</em></p>

<p>I received my report in an email. ADHD, social anxiety, and maybe somewhere on the Autism spectrum as well. I thought of my queer friends who hadn’t managed to get an appointment with someone sympathetic to queer experiences and spent so much money only to not be treated fairly.</p>

<p>I went to my GP, did a blood test and an ECG, waited a few days, and got my Ritalin prescription. I slowly increased my dosage over a few weeks until I felt I reached a comfortable balance. Made an appointment for an Autism screening session.</p>

<p>Ritalin is helping me tap into that hyper-focus mode more easily now. Is this what day-to-day life is like for other people? It feels strange to be just able to be productive like this. I’m trying to cherish it. Other than that though I have a lot of homework to do. I still don’t understand why my brain is the way it is, what stimulates it and what makes it struggle. But knowing that some of those feelings have a name now has helped me finally feel like less of an alien. Less of an outlier. <strong>More human.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>I’m trying hard not to revisit memories of having difficulty managing my workload in jobs, getting fired, and struggling to find employment again. Wondering what my life would be like if I had been diagnosed as a kid. When I told my mum that I had been diagnosed she said she had always had a hunch that I had something. <em>I wonder what life would have been like.</em></p>

<p>I’m trying hard to think about all the times my inconsistency and missed deadlines and lack of focus were met with opportunities and chances and grace. I wonder what life would have been like if I looked different or sounded different or was born in a different place. <strong>I wonder would life would have been like.</strong></p>

<p>I’m moving forward with more of an understanding of my brain than I’ve ever had before, and I hope as many people as possible can have that same experience.</p>

<p>If you’re a queer person who hasn’t been able to afford to go through the process of an ADHD screening, please reach out. My email is <a href="mailto:contact@wolfjay.com">contact at wolfjay dot com</a>. I don’t have much money, but I do have a small community of people who care. I’d like to help if I can, in whatever way is useful to you. Thank you for reading this, <em>and if you’re ever in doubt</em> - <strong>please know that you are human and that you aren’t alone.</strong></p>
