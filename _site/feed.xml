<p>In primary school, I was just undisciplined, lazy, a “gifted student” who lacked the dedication to fulfil my potential.</p>

<p>In high school, I was just depressed, anxious, and “emo” - to the point of breaking the school’s record for absentee days (91 in a single year) while still being near the top of most of my classes.</p>

<p>As an adult, I was just unfocused, inconsistent, and unreliable.</p>

<p>This led to really poor mental health, which led to mental health care plans, which led to counsellors trying to give me new ways of framing the same shitty situations. I felt like an alien. I didn’t feel like I was incredibly isolated from people around me, other than the people I bonded with specifically over our shared struggles with undiagnosed ADHD symptoms - particularly members of the queer community.</p>

<h3 id="but-with-everyone-i-looked-up-to-growing-up-telling-me-i-just-needed-to-work-harder-i-kept-pushing-and-struggling-and-burning-out">But with everyone I looked up to growing up telling me I just needed to work harder, I kept pushing and struggling and burning out.</h3>

<p>I thought it might just be anxious about money, so slowly got better-paying jobs. I thought it might be stress from turbulent living situations, so I moved out on my own. I thought it might be an addiction to work, so adopted a few dogs to keep me active and distract me from constantly working.</p>

<p>But even after all of those things, I was still struggling all of the time. And a lot of my friends haven’t made it that far. <strong>A lot of my friends didn’t make it that far.</strong></p>

<p>For a while, I thought I was just clever enough to keep my head above water despite everything. But now I realise it’s because despite undiagnosed ADHD I was given opportunities, flexibility, and the benefit of the doubt that isn’t given to everyone. I’m a young, 28-year-old, mostly healthy, white person, with a western name, who can easily pass as a straight white cis man in most situations.</p>

<p>My friends who were only diagnosed with ADHD as adults didn’t grow up wealthy. I do not think that’s a coincidence. My friends who didn’t make it to 28 weren’t given the same benefit of the doubt I have been afforded. I do not think that’s a coincidence. Health does not exist in a vacuum, and privilege seeps into every crevice and influences everything it touches.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of my friends, and at any other point in my adult life, I was able to afford the upfront $950 fee and wait for my Medicare rebate. <strong>What happens for people who can’t afford that?</strong></p>

<p class="post-caption">waiting to join a $1000 zoom call</p>

<p>I waited four months for my telehealth session. It went well. I saw <a href="https://www.yourhealthinmind.org/find-a-psychiatrist/profile/7841/dr-steve-chau?country=AU&amp;state=VIC&amp;seed=957843&amp;onlineConsultations=false&amp;radius=10&amp;expertiseIn=%5B%5D&amp;servicesOffered=%5B31%5D&amp;experienceWith=%5B%5D&amp;treatsAges=%5B%5D&amp;languages=%5B%5D&amp;page=1">Dr Steven Chau at The Melbourne Clinic</a> who had been recommended to me by a lovely queer friend around my age who had recently been diagnosed with ADHD. It lasted a few hours. Dr Chau asked me about my experiences growing up, at school, and at work. What things are like for me socially. I told him as much as I could. Most of it was very hard to recall. <em>A lot of memories I’d tried to forget.</em></p>

<p>I received my report in an email. ADHD, social anxiety, and maybe somewhere on the Autism spectrum as well. I thought of my queer friends who hadn’t managed to get an appointment with someone sympathetic to queer experiences and spent so much money only to not be treated fairly.</p>

<p>I went to my GP, did a blood test and an ECG, waited a few days, and got my Ritalin prescription. I slowly increased my dosage over a few weeks until I felt I reached a comfortable balance. Made an appointment for an Autism screening session.</p>

<p>Ritalin is helping me tap into that hyper-focus mode more easily now. Is this what day-to-day life is like for other people? It feels strange to be just able to be productive like this. I’m trying to cherish it. Other than that though I have a lot of homework to do. I still don’t understand why my brain is the way it is, what stimulates it and what makes it struggle. But knowing that some of those feelings have a name now has helped me finally feel like less of an alien. Less of an outlier. <strong>More human.</strong></p>

<h3 id="im-trying-hard-not-to-revisit-memories-of-having-difficulty-managing-my-workload-in-jobs-getting-fired-and-struggling-to-find-employment-again-wondering-what-my-life-would-be-like-if-i-had-been-diagnosed-as-a-kid-when-i-told-my-mum-that-i-had-been-diagnosed-she-said-she-had-always-had-a-hunch-that-i-might-have-something-i-wonder-what-life-would-have-been-like">I’m trying hard not to revisit memories of having difficulty managing my workload in jobs, getting fired, and struggling to find employment again. Wondering what my life would be like if I had been diagnosed as a kid. When I told my mum that I had been diagnosed she said she had always had a hunch that I might have something. <em>I wonder what life would have been like.</em></h3>

<p>I’m trying hard to think about all the times my inconsistency and missed deadlines and lack of focus were met with opportunities and chances and grace. I wonder what life would have been like if I looked different or sounded different or was born in a different place. <strong>I wonder would life would have been like.</strong></p>

<p>I’m moving forward with more of an understanding of my brain than I’ve ever had before, and I hope as many people as possible can have that same experience.</p>

<p>Hello! my name is jackie, nice to meet you / nice to see you again. This is the first installment of something I’ve been thinking about for a long time: <em>an annual report for my wolfjay project</em>. I’ve wanted to do an annual report-ish thing for years, but turns out I’m really good at thinking of reasons why I simply can’t do one. But fuck all of them! This might be imperfect, but I’m gonna give it a red hot go 🥵</p>

<p>I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about the impact I want to have on the community around me, and one of the things that felt important to me was wanting to make things easier for others than they were for me. Especially young queer artists. Marginalised groups don’t have the same support networks that their priveleged peers do. We need to stick together! 💗 I don’t know how much of this will be useful, but I’m hoping that the transparency will maybe help a little.</p>

<p>To me, wolfjay is a chance to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>make friends with a bunch of cool people doing cool shit</li>
  <li>be sincere about shit that isn’t too cringe</li>
  <li>think big and think small</li>
  <li>do fun shit with computers + music tech + socials + marketing</li>
  <li>also super low risk so I can fuck around with shit I’m interested in without impacting if I can pay rent or not</li>
</ul>

<p>@ other artists, the priorities I have for this project might not match what you want out of yours, so please bear that in mind 😌</p>

<h3 id="income---">income 💰 💸 😩</h3>

<p>In 2021-2022 I made $3368.75 off of music, with most of that coming from live performance and physical bandcamp sales. This is a bunch more than previous years! Mostly because I’m playing solo now so don’t have to pay for rehearsal rooms and someone’s fee, and only have to cover transport / food / drink / other shit for one person. Also put my rate up a bit and for the most part played shows that were paid at least a $250 performance fee, often closer to $400.</p>

<p>This is also the first time that I’ve been able to do merch, after just paralysing anxiety around ever making my money back in the past. BUT I met super cool lovely angel <a href="https://instagram.com/sicknasty.xyz">@sicknasty.xyz</a> who helped me plan out a preorder only merch drop. People’s preorders paid for the merch run, the shirts were printed SUPER fast, and people got their orders within a month of ordering. Fucking sick. And made a bit of money :)</p>

<p>I did two different designs, both based on art my pal <a href="https://instagram.com/picapsso?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">@picapsso</a> made for my EP artwork :) I also tried out A5 lino prints printed by tree paper gallery here in Naarm, but they didn’t sell very well. If anyone wants one <a href="https://wolfjay.bandcamp.com/merch/dichotomy-print">please buy one</a>, I have a drawer full of them still lol.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/ar21-22/WJ-21-22-income.png" alt="WJ-21-22-income" /></p>

<p>The next biggest source of income for me was APRA AMCOS royalties, mostly because two of my songs got synced for an SBS show <a href="https://iview.abc.net.au/show/heights">The Heights</a>. They found my music after looking on <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplejunearthed/artist/wolfjay/">Triple J Unearthed</a>, and the show has been broadcast internationally which led to several larger than normal payments from APRA.</p>

<p>Lastly, and somewhat unsurprisingly, streaming made up less than 1% of my income. I had to round it up for the graph in order for it to be visible. This is only made by my releases up to <a href="https://wolfjay.bandcamp.com/track/she-calls-to-me">She Calls To Me</a>, all of my releases after that were released on ‘Sleep Well Records’. The deal I have with them is a 50/50 split for 7 years, and I only start getting paid after the costs recoup. I haven’t gotten anything off streaming from these tracks yet.</p>

<h3 id="expenses---">expenses 🤑 🤡 😭</h3>

<p>My expenses all up were $8118.99. This is broken down to contributing to my utilities bills at home, mixing and mastering costs associated with finishing songs, putting on/playing shows, making merch, and purchasing equipment to make music.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/ar21-22/WJ-21-22-expenses.png" alt="WJ-21-22-expenses" /></p>

<p>Normally this would be much more balanced, but due to lockdowns and being anxious around being in venues due to COVID the money I spent was much further weighted towards buying gear. Around 30% of this equipment were basic studio tools like speakers and cables so that I could make use of my spare room as a production space, with the remaining 70% being buying components for my live setup so that I can easily and reliably play solo shows with live guitar and backing tracks.</p>

<p>This included getting my pedalboard professionally built by Nick Smethurst aka <a href="https://instagram.com/pedalboring">@pedalboring</a>, local legend who taught me SO much about gear selection, board development, and best practices for reliability. I’ve not had a single issue with my live setup at the several shows I’ve played since completing it, and it also doubles as having a reliable way to track great sounding guitars at home, and a really flexible effects chain to route audio through for reamping meaning I can use all of my gear for way more applications, without having to rewire anything. I’ve been able to get much more done during sessions than I previously would, because I’m no longer having to stop to address technical issues. I expect this to pay even further dividends next financial year when I’m able to perform more frequently.</p>

<p>Merch production was my next biggest expense, which is great because they were my second largest source of income. This covered blank t-shirt purchasing, printing with Sick Nasty, compostable shipping packaging, and shipment.</p>

<h3 id="some-shit-i-wanna-try---️">some shit I wanna try 🫵 🌯 🧘‍♂️</h3>

<h4 id="better-reporting">better reporting</h4>
<p>So that I can have better data for next years report I should definitely track my budgets a lot better! would be sick to have per project budgets as well as year total income/expenses so I can suss the viability of projects.</p>

<h4 id="publishing--sync">publishing + sync</h4>
<p>I’m not interesting in playing the publishing game of endless soul destroying cowriting sessions churning out hearless songs that are mid at best just for a publisher to try hype up and drop the second you don’t get thos streams BUT I do want to reach out to some sync agents and see if they want to rep my stuff so I can try and get some sync spots :)</p>

<h4 id="production-skills">production skills</h4>
<p>Want to get way better at production! Happy with how my guitar production work sounds after spending a bunch of time on it and investing in my setup and workflow, but want to be better at the electronic side of things. I’ve had a bunch of false starts in this over the last year or so, trying to buy and learn gear to help flesh out my understanding in this area (fucked around but didn’t click with the waldorf blofeld, elektron digitakt, poly beebo) but want to have another run at things! I’ve been invited to be a part of <a href="https://mess.foundation">Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio</a>’s 12 week advanced professional development course which will definitely help with this!</p>

<p><em>(side note: I started writing this months ago and just had the final week of the advanced PD course at Mess and ugh yeah I’m way fucking better at elec production now lol BUT ALAS I NEED TO KEEP UP THE FACADE THAT I PUBLISHED THIS AT THE START OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR DESPITE IT NOW BEING OCTOBER)</em></p>

<h4 id="my-live-set">my live set</h4>
<p>My live setup at the moment is a bit of a hangover from when I was playing live with a drummer, just playing along to a backing track without much interaction. I try augment it with some cool guitar stuff and manipulation with pedals but it doesn’t feel right yet. I used to have an octatrack that i had to sell to pay rent when I first moved to Naarm (fuckin rip) and really want to grab a mk1 if one pops up at a decent price! Also I reckon the guitar live is a bit of a crutch for me, can’t move around much when I’m playing and have had way more fun in rehearsals when I’m just singing. Want to try out using the octa for playback + sampling, and running my vocals through some of my pedals. Maybe have a little synth as well who knows hehe!</p>

<h4 id="changing-up-my-release-process">changing up my release process</h4>
<p>I’ve been releasing stuff for the last few years through Sleep Well Records, run by Alyse Vellturo aka pronoun who’s been the fuckin best. I’ve learned so much from her and become really good friends. Hanging out with her in NYC in march 2020 was fuckin surreal and made me real happy. I’ve started thinking about all the cool shit I could do if I cough maybe started my own label cough (thinking out loud here let’s see how things go) 😬</p>

<h4 id="apply-for-some-fuckin-grants-you-grub">apply for some fuckin grants you grub</h4>
<p>moneys sick, would love to have some money to do some things</p>

<h4 id="establish-the-wolfjay-cinematic-universe">establish the wolfjay cinematic universe</h4>
<p>Just want to do more shit! Like, idk, a blog! or some videos about shit I think is cool shit! wolfjay is a frame of mind, time isn’t linear, etc, ie.</p>

<h4 id="smaller-slices-more-frequently">smaller slices more frequently</h4>
<p>A friend was telling me about this shit they do, eating heaps of small meals a day instead of big meals, sounds like something that could be cool with making stuff. I like to have ideas for big things but folks I simply do not have the time or money or attention span to see it through, gonna try doing little things every few weeks instead and see how that shit goes. 🤡<br /><br /></p>

<p>Made a little spreadsheet situation to see the average time between releases of wolfjay music and golly it was simply too much time between releases. Since I started wolfjay in 2017 on average i’ve put something out every 5 months. Since I signed with sleep well it crept up to every 7 months. I just passed a year since I put anything out! Don’t like that at all! More shit more often please!</p>

<p>I know there’s a lot of goals there! let’s see how I go! thanks for checking this out and I hope there was something in there for you :) ty for reading! love u! ciao ciao gossip wolfjay xoxo</p>

<p>my name is jackie :) i’ve been doing stuff as wolfjay since 2017 :)</p>

<p>This is a little blog for me to drop down thoughts about things. I’ve tried having a website in the past but I don’t think many people looked at it and it made me anxious about writing things on it because it looked so fancy and the writing wasn’t fancy.</p>

<p>i’ve wanted a little blog for so long!</p>

<p>My friends talk about their ‘tumblr phases’ and pull up their archives of posts and have beautiful imperfect records of what they were into at different times. I do not :) my online existence has been scattered across platforms and phases and friendship groups and communities. From the outside I think it would look like I’m just really inconsistent and non-committal, but I don’t think that’s fair. I’m so ready to commit to something, I’m just trying to find something that feels nice.</p>

<p>I like forums, they’re cool, but sometimes I just forget they exist and disappear.</p>

<p>I like twitter, but there’s so much going on there. Are my tweets still cool if no one else thinks they’re cool?</p>

<p>Facebook sucks</p>

<p>Instagram sucks</p>

<p>Close friends is ehhhhhhh, but I feel shitty if I share something and no one responds</p>

<p>so here’s a little blog :) I fought with the command line on my computer for a solid 2 hours today to get it to compile properly.</p>

<p>It looks shitty at the moment :)</p>

<p>am going to keep fucking around with things and build up a nice little custom theme for myself maybe!</p>

<p>I learned about Jekyll during university and setup my first site with the help of someone in my class for a journal while I was in bangkok on a month long study trip. It sucked! I overcooked it too much and made it not fun.</p>

<p>I have a few ideas for things I want to write about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>annual report each year on my income from music and what I spent money on</li>
  <li>breakdowns of projects and go into all the nitty gritty detail that gets glossed over when just publishing shit</li>
  <li>try and breakdown my thought processes around new things I want to do</li>
  <li>forget this exists for a while and disappear while I do fun things then pop back when I want to talk about those things :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways I think I’m all done for now, I want to publish this tonight then get something to eat and hang out with my dogs. lol first blog post hehe</p>
